## Setup of the backend

This backend was created using Node & MongoDB.
In order to start your project, you need to create a .env file with the following information:

```
NODE_ENV_DB_ID=vivien_noel
NODE_ENV_DB_PASSWORD=O6FCWBl6umMi12cM
NODE_ENV_DB_NAME=pokedex
NODE_ENV_PORT=3001
```

Please remember that these information shouldn't be shared in a real project, as the .env file ensure that these information remain private.

### Getting started

In order to start your server, you need to install the dependencies using npm:
```
npm install
```

And then to enter the following command line:
```
npm run dev
```

##### The server is now listening.

You can therefore go to your frontend and start your application.
